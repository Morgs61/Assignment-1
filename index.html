<h1>My IT Profile</h1>


<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Name: 			Morgan Cassar</p>
<img src="me.jpg" width="720" height=960">
<p>Student Number:	s3858530</p>
<p>Email Address:		s3858530@student.rmit.com.au</p>

<p>I live in Melbourne, Victoria. My background is Maltese and Irish, but my parents were born in Australia as well. </p>
<p>I’ve already completed a double degree in Psychology (Science) and Criminology and Forensic Science (Arts) at Swinburne University of Technology in Hawthorn, which I completed in 2018.</p>
<p>I play and coach hockey at the Kew Box Hill Hockey Club. I’ve been playing since 2009 and I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>I also have a dog called Ralph, his breed is a schnoodle, and he is about 18 months old.</p>

<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT, comes from spending lots of time around technology throughout my life. I got my first computer when I was in grade 3 or 4 at school, and always showed interest. My father was always interest in technology, so I think his interest sparked my interest and my natural ability to pick up new technology systems easily. In terms of experience, I don’t have much IT experience, the only thing is in Year 12 I completed software development as a VCE Unit. Other than that, I have no experience, just daily use of computers.</p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT, as they offered the course online. The fact that I can study online and from home, takes a bit of the strain out of it. As I can continue to work and complete my other activities, and still make classes when all I have to do is sit at my computer.
I also had two friends who completed IT courses at RMIT, both said it was a great university of IT, one of them switched from Deakin to RMIT because of this.</p>
<p>I expect to learn a whole wide range of things from my studies and I couldn’t be more excited. For this unit I assume I will learn a wide range of things related to Information Technology, rather than just a few specific things, as this is an introduction subject.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41044375?type=standout#searchRequestToken=ccadfd4f-c0ed-4187-aaae-bc1ec88c0537">Ideal Job</a>
<img src="Job.jpg" width="324" height=530">
<p>Cyber Security Manager, is a position which is responsible for leading and managing a team that creates and implements security procedures, guidelines and standards for multiple information technology platforms.</p>
<p>This position requires,</p>
<ul>
	<li>management of the Information System and to ensure that it is secure</li>
	<li>management of developing and implementation of strategies, procedures, controls, guidelines, and security standards for system environments including ICT network security.</li>
	<li>Planning and managing operations for the ICT security, dealing with Antivirus, Security Incident Event Management, Intrusion Protection and Vulnerability assessment.
</ul>
<p>I find this position quite interesting as it pairs my past studies with my current studies. I previously have studied Psychology, and Criminology and Forensic Science, currently I’m Studying Information Technology. This appeals to me so much, as I’ve always had an interest in security and criminals, hence my previous studies. My current studies will help me be able to reach this goal.</p>
<p>This job requires a great deal of knowledge relating to risk management practices, as well as current information and communication technologies infrastructure requirements. They would like you to have worked previously in a company that is a large geographically dispersed organisation, which have been implementing similar practices to their security systems. The ability to plan, implement, and monitor communication strategies as well as security awareness programs for a large organisation, and the ability to engage and involve people.
They want the candidate to have the confidence to challenge problems, raise objections constructively when analysing and assessing security issues or intrusions. 
They would also prefer if the candidate has very strong oral and written communication skills, as they want the candidate to be able to negotiate and consult with a wide variety of clients and stakeholders about security systems.</p>
<p> In terms of my own skills, knowledge and experience, I do not have any workplace experience in working in a large security organisation. However, I do have a degree in Psychology, Criminology and Forensic science, which could hold some weight in terms of the security side of things. As well as the completion of my current course of IT. I have had some experience in negotiating and consulting people. In my current job, I work as a Front-End Supervisor at Woolworths, so I’m constantly communicating with customers (clients), helping them with their needs and queries. As well as this, having an eye for people who are stealing groceries etc. could relate to security. I also feel that I can speak up and question those higher up than I, when I’m unsure about the way we do something at work. For example, currently at Woolworths due to the outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus), the shop has been spun into a frenzy, with limits on items in every aisle. I’m in charge of online orders, and although there was a one pack limit for toilet paper in the shop, online there was no limit. I felt that I should tell my store manager that I would only be supplying the online customers with one packet of toilet paper, as it would be unfair to those who came to the shop and missed out.</p>
<p>A way in which I would be able to achieve the rest of the skills, qualifications and experience which is required for me to obtain such a position, would be to first complete this degree, hopefully picking up some relevant work experience along the way. Once graduated, it would be ideal to get a job in either IT or Security to get a head start in either, obviously a job such as an IT consultant at a company such as a bank or a local business, would be good as it would implement both IT and Security. A more specific path could be something through Victoria Police, in their IT department, as I feel it would be a great introduction to IT and Security. However, before being able to land the Job as described above, I feel that it would be necessary to obtain another job in IT security after the police department.</p>

<h2>My Personal Profile</h2>
<h3>Myers-Briggs</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, is to connect the psychological types theory to people’s lives, making it more understandable. It proposes 16 different personality types, based on four major dimensions of personality type (Myers and Briggs Foundation, 2020). The four major dimensions are, Introversion v Extraversion, Sensing v Intuition, Thinking v Feeling, and Perceiving v Judging.</p>
<p>After completing a Myers-Briggs Test (The TypeFinder® Personality Test, 2020), the personality type that I got matched as was ISTP. This personality type is described as tolerant and flexible, someone who is quiet, and waits for a problem to appear before acting quickly to find a range of solutions. Someone who is interested in using logical principles, value efficiency and cause and effect (Myers and Briggs Foundation, 2020). </p>

<h3>Learning Style Assessment</h3>
<p>A Learning Style Assessment is a test which is used to understand and evaluate how you as a learning best do your learning (Bentley University, 2020). The four different learning styles are, Visual Learners, Auditory Learners, Reading/Writing Learners, Kinaesthetic Learners (Nakano, 2016).
After completing a Learning Style Assessment test (How-To-Study.com and SOAR Learning, 2020), the learning style which was best suited for me was the Visual Learning Style. This tells me that I prefer to see information, and I learn best from charts and graphics.</p>

<h3>The Big Five Personality Test</h3>
<p>The Big Five Personality Test scores you on five different measures of personality (Truity, 2020).</p>
<ul>
	<li>Openness, a person’s tendency to think in complex ways, people who score high on Openness are usually creative, adventurous and intellectual. Strongly related to a person’s interest in art and culture.</li>
	<li>Conscientiousness, a person’s ability to practise self-control and discipline, people who score high on conscientiousness are usually organized and determined </li>
	<li>Extraversion, a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, usually through attention from others. Extravert v Introvert.</li>
	<li>Agreeableness, a person’s tendency to put others’ needs before their own, and to cooperate rather than compete. People who score high experience a lot of empathy and get pleasure out of helping others.</li>
	<li>Neuroticism, a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions such as, fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt and shame. People who score high, are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger or sadness.</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing The Big Five Personality Test, I received percentages out of 100 for each measure.
Openness 37.5%; Conscientiousness 58%; Extraversion 33%; Agreeableness 71%; Neuroticism 44%. This shows I scored highest on the Agreeableness and Conscientiousness personality measures (Truity, 2020).</p>

<p>	I think that the results of these tests mean a wide variety of things, the results from my Myers-Briggs Test shows that I am a more reserved individual, who is more reactive to a situation with logical solutions, rather than a project starter and ideas person. It suggests that I may be a tolerant and flexible individual in terms of working in projects or teams. The results form my Learning Style Assessment suggests that I learn better from visual aids rather than auditory or reading stimulants. The results from The Big Five Personality Test suggests that I am more an introverted individual than an extravert, who is usually organized and determined, with the ability to practise self-discipline and control. As well as an individual who has the tendency to put others before themselves, and someone who is cooperative and enjoys working in a team.</p>
<p>In terms of working in a team, I think that these results show that I would be well equipped to work in a team. Through the Big Five Personality test, I scored highest on the agreeableness measure, generally this suggests that I would prefer to work cooperatively, and that I enjoy putting others needs before my own. This could suggest that I don’t like letting my team down. Based on my Myers-Briggs Test results, it suggests that I am a tolerant and flexible person, which is essential for teamwork, as being able to listen and take information on from other team members is essential. In terms of the results from my Learning Style Assessment, it could suggest getting together and working in a team using visual aids would be best for my style of input, and maybe as a way to communicate ideas across to other members of the team.</p>
<p>The way in which you should take all this information into account when forming teams, is team chemistry. A good team isn’t all filled with the same type of person, to make a good team you need a wide range of people that can work cohesively and effectively together. In terms of using these tests to form a team, I feel that you could not have a team full of introverted individuals who all learn best from a reading learning style, as there would be very little input and it might be hard for the team to get started. If you use a mix of people with different personality types it helps everyone get involved and each member has their unique task based on what they’re good at. </p>

<h2>Project</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The project which I am proposing, is a health and fitness application / monitor for dogs. This app will monitor a wide variety of things for you dog, so you can make sure your best friend is living their best life. Using a collar, it can track your dogs, heart rate, sleeping patterns, body temperature. It tracks how far you dog moves in a day, how many kilometres they have walked and has a GPS tracker. You can also set fitness goals and connects online to compare to dogs around the world. All which can be viewed in an easy to use app, on you Android or iOS device.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>The motivation behind creating this application / device is that I know that a lot of people are constantly worried about their dog and are always wondering if they’re okay or not. I’ve had a few health scares with my dog, due to overexertion and with this application it can be avoidable. In Australia, 40% of households with a pet have a dog, the most of any pet in the country, so there is a massive market for an application like this. Using the MIT App Inventor, it would be a great a cost-effective way to create the application that can connect to a collar which is using Raspberry Pi’s another cost-effective solution for this project.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This product requires two technologies, the first being a dog collar which is put around the dog’s neck, which has the ability to measure your dog’s vitalities and sends you alerts when these get to abnormal levels. The different vitals that the collar measures are</p>
<ul>
	<li>Heart rate, tracks the heart rate of your dog through sleep and exercise. If your dogs heart rate drops abnormally low or high, you will receive an alert to your smartphone. </li>
	<li>Body temperature, measures your dog’s body temperature throughout the day. If your dogs body temperature gets abnormally low or high, a smartphone alert is sent. </p>
	<li>Body position, tracks how often your dog is standing, sitting or lying, which side they’re lying on etc. and the application uses data to determine if your dog may be experiencing pain based on the way they’re positioning themselves.</li>
	<li>Sleep quality, like human sleeping applications, this does the same for your dog as it tracks how long your dog sleeps for, the quality of its sleep and long it spent in deep sleep. This can also indicate problems associated with your dog.</li>
	<li>It also contains a GPS in the collar so you can track your dogs exercise, it will track how far they walk, and how fast they run, and it can be used in the application to compare to other dogs around the world. The GPS also can be used to track your dog if he ever gets lost or finds his way out of the house.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second technology is the mobile phone application for both Android and iOS. It is a user-friendly mobile application which uses graphs to display your dog’s vitalities across the day/week/month/year, so you can always know when your dog is ever feeling off or not themselves. </p>
<p>As stated previously, it can get sent notifications and alerts when certain measures are out of the normal range for your dog. The way this works is that it uses the data it tracks from your dog to create a normal range, and whenever your dog measures a value that is either below or above this range, you will receive an alert.</p>
<p>For example, you have had the collar for about 2 months, so the application has about 8 weeks of data on your dog, it has started to create averages for each measure of your dog. One day your dog is playing fetch at the park on a very hot day. Your dog starts to slow done a little, but you don’t take much notice, then you receive a notification saying, “Ralph’s body temperature is above normal, get him some water and let him cool down”. This would help prevent and risk of danger to your dog, if you didn’t have the app, you might continue playing with him until he gets so hot, he passes out or collapses.</p>
<p>The app also has an online feature, which allows you to compare the statistics of your dog to all different dogs around the world, allowing you to view by specific breed or by country.</p>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>To create the Smart Dog Collar, we would use a Raspberry Pi, with abilities to monitor vitalities, via heart rate monitors and temperatures, as well as an inbuilt GPS. It can connect to mobile devices via Bluetooth, to share data to the application. This would be fitted to a leather collar, that comes in a variety of colours. </p>
<p>Using the MIT App Inventor, we would be able to create our application that works alongside the Smart Dog Collar. Connecting via Bluetooth, the application is also able to connect to the internet to allow for comparison to other dogs.</p>

<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>The skills required for this project, is the ability to write a mobile phone application using MIT App Inventor, which has the ability to connect via Bluetooth to another device, as well as the ability to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>Also, someone who can build the special hardware device that can track our dog’s vitalities, using a Raspberry Pi. I think that it would be feasible to find the hardware and software to be able to complete this project, as it is like a lot of health applications for humans. So, finding someone with the skill to be able to create this project would be feasible as there is similar applications and devices out there, that does the same tests for humans.</p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>The outcome of this project, if it is successful, would be that we would finally be able to track our dog’s health and activities, to make sure our best friend is in the best of health and happiness. The original problem, of needing a way to measure and make sure our dogs are happy and healthy would be solved, as this project is designed to ensure your pet is always healthy and never feeling uncomfortable. The impact of this development would create a healthy culture for dog owners around the world. The competitive ability of comparing your dog's kilometres walked and speed to other dogs around the world will create a healthy competition for dogs, and will improve the overall health of dogs who use the application. </p>
